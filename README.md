# Unsupervised Learning Data Analysis: Clustering
**Clustering** is a type of unsupervised learning in machine learning and data analysis that involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a **cluster**) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, and bioinformatics.
